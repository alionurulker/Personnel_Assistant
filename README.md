<h3 align="center" style="font-size:20pt; font-family:Calibri;">Personnel Assistant| Mobile Application &amp; Automatic Plate Recognition System</h3>
<p style="font-size:15pt; font-family:Calibri;">
Pesonnel Assistant has a well-structured code with a mobile application interface, which aims to be used for corporate or government offices, where entrance security is provided for car parks by identifying license plates on vehicles using image processing algorithms, and where team workers support business solidarity with real-time messaging with each other.
</p>
<p style="font-size:15pt; font-family:Calibri;">
A real-time license plate recognition system has been developed with the Python programming language using the OpenCV (open source computer vision) library, which is based on the k-NN algorithm, for reading the vehicle license plates that the employees have recorded in the database for entry from the company door. While testing the license plate recognition system, experiments were performed on images taken from different positions and from different environments. In the project, using the Flutter and Dart software languages, the application and license plate recognition system, which will allow the company employees to communicate with each other via mobile, are stored in the Firebase Cloud Firestore database system, which is a cloud-based NoSQL service.
